## The challenge

We had to make an interactive whiteboard which we named "DJP Board" on the name of our team. It can be used to write, draw, scribble, sketch or do anything you wanna do with some basic tools like pen tool with multiple color options, erase tool, background color changing tool, pattern tool, text tool. You can also save your boards with the download option and undo, redo some stuff or even delete the whole board if you want. You can also use Infiboard for infinite board where you can keep drawing by just zooming in or out as much as you want!
